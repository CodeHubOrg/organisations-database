#CodeHub JavaScript Resources Project

This app was started as part of CodeHub's JS101 group, in order to work together on a project and practise using new JavaScript technologies.    
     
The original idea was to display a list of independent shops in Bristol, then we decided to keep it more generic and called it Organisations Database. But since, we have switched its purpose to display JavaScript resources and the generic term which is used in the app is now just Item.     

## Technologies used
* Node/Express
* React
* Redux
* Webpack
* LokiJS

The app is by now mostly written in ES2015.

## Getting started

* You'll need a recent copy of node from: https://nodejs.org/
* Run: `npm install` to install dependencies.
* Run: `npm start` to run the app and view it on http://localhost:3000

Help:
- The app is currently very similar to the todomvc example: https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc
